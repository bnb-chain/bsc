# 1.Background
This is to support some projects with customized tokens that they want to integrate into the BSC faucet tool.

## 1.1. How to Integrate Your Token
- Step 1: Fund the faucet address by sending a specific amount of your BEP-20 token to the faucet address (0xaa25aa7a19f9c426e07dee59b12f944f4d9f1dd3) on the BSC testnet.
- Step 2: Update this README.md file and create a Pull Request on [bsc github](https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc) with relevant information.

We will review the request, and once it is approved, the faucet tool will start to support the customized token and list it on https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet.
